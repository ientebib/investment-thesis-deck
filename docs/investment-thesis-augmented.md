# Investment Thesis (Augmented, Slide-by-Slide)

Purpose: standalone thesis narrative that mirrors the deck while integrating the expanded model and data work.

Use this as the external AI-consumable version. It is intentionally not tied to repository internals.

## Thesis In One Page

- Core objective: pair downside-protective collateral with upside convexity in liquid structural themes.
- Portfolio architecture: maintain a two-sleeve design where real estate is the cash-flow and collateral base, and the structural long sleeve is the growth engine.
- Capital loop: raise LP equity, acquire stabilized NNN assets, refinance at conservative LTV (target ~55%), and redeploy net refinance proceeds into the structural long sleeve.
- Why this is different: the fund does not rely on pure multiple expansion or unsecured leverage; it monetizes hard-asset collateral to finance liquid upside exposure.
- Return engine: contractual rent and collateral stability from the NNN sleeve plus compounding from structural long exposures tied to macro repricing and AI buildout bottlenecks.
- Target balance: in default underwriting, day-1 exposure is roughly balanced between real-estate equity (~$9.0M) and structural long deployment (~$9.805M), preserving the “half anchored, half convex” profile.
- Primary risks: refinancing rates at year 10, property-level tenant/credit events, and volatility in structural-long positions.
- Risk controls: conservative leverage, debt-service reserve logic, explicit underwriting gates, position sizing rules, and a preferred-return-first waterfall before carry.

## Slide 03

- Section: FUND STRUCTURE
- Title: Capital Structure and Deployment Mix
- Thesis: Stabilized NNN collateral base paired with a liquid structural sleeve for upside participation

### What This Slide Adds

- The fund is intentionally split into two sleeves: a real-estate collateral base and a liquid structural long portfolio.
- The real-estate sleeve is built around long-duration, investment-grade NNN leases designed to produce durable cash flow.
- The structural sleeve concentrates on long-horizon themes in commodities, infrastructure, and technology where physical bottlenecks can drive repricing.

### Evidence (Only What Matters)

- The structure is designed so the collateral sleeve protects the downside while refinance-generated capital funds the upside sleeve.

## Slide 04

- Section: FUND STRUCTURE
- Title: How capital flows through the structure
- Thesis: 100% equity acquisition → 55% LTV cash-out refinance → structural long portfolio

### What This Slide Adds

- The fund starts by acquiring stabilized NNN property with LP equity.
- After seasoning and financing optimization, the property is refinanced at target ~55% LTV.
- Net refinance proceeds are deployed into the structural long portfolio while the property remains the collateral anchor.
- This is the mechanism that creates a roughly balanced two-sleeve portfolio rather than a pure real-estate fund.

### Evidence (Only What Matters)

- Illustrative flow: $20.0M LP equity acquires the asset base, then a 55% LTV cash-out refinance releases ~$11.0M.
- After formation, acquisition, and origination costs (~$0.82M), net redeployment to the structural long sleeve is about $10.18M.
- In the default underwriting path, this creates near-parity between the real-estate equity base and the structural long sleeve at inception.

### Mechanics (If Material)

- Sequence is deterministic accounting, not narrative estimation: equity in, asset purchase, refinance proceeds, cost deductions, then long-sleeve deployment.
- The property remains on balance sheet as collateral and rent engine while the long sleeve carries macro/AI convexity.

### Source Note

- Illustrative deployment · $20M LP capital · Upfront costs include formation, acquisition, and origination fees

## Slide 05

- Section: REAL ESTATE FOUNDATION
- Title: Illustrative NNN lease opportunities
- Thesis: The types of properties we target — investment-grade tenants, absolute NNN structure, long-duration cash flows

### What This Slide Adds

- Typical financing posture is conservative: ~50-60% LTV, multi-year fixed window, and long amortization.
- Operating plan is to collect rent, season assets, and optimize the debt profile before refinance windows.
- Sourcing edge is relationship-driven across Florida, Texas, and the Southeast U.S.
- Underwriting focuses on tenant credit, lease quality, location durability, and replacement-cost support.

## Slide 06

- Section: REAL ESTATE FOUNDATION
- Title: NNN leases in Florida: structure and financing
- Thesis: The asset, location edge, and debt profile

### What This Slide Adds

- Triple-net (NNN): the tenant pays property taxes, insurance, and maintenance. The landlord collects rent with low operating leakage.
- Target tenants are investment-grade corporates on long-duration leases with built-in rent escalators.
- The financing design explicitly plans for year-10 refinance/balloon risk instead of assuming frictionless exits.
- The strategic purpose of the sleeve is stability: contractual rent and collateral value support the full portfolio through cycles.

### Evidence (Only What Matters)

- Florida net domestic migration in the sample rises from about 235k to about 380k, with a recent peak near 444k (2022) and trough near 210k (2020).

### Mechanics (If Material)

- Baseline assumptions: $20M property value, 6.0% entry cap, 55% LTV, 5.5% loan rate, 30-year amortization, 10-year hold, 1.5% NOI growth.
- Annual NOI and debt service are modeled year by year; surplus cash is tracked explicitly and compounded at a treasury proxy.
- Balloon exposure is treated as a first-order risk variable, not a residual footnote.
- Default-case reference outputs: annual debt service ~$0.749M, year-10 cumulative surplus ~$6.211M, year-10 balloon ~$9.08M.

- Title: Two foundational macro views for the long portfolio
- Thesis: Two foundational macro views for the long portfolio

### What This Slide Adds

- AI displaces labor income that funds the majority of sovereign tax revenue, widening deficits through the political response.
- The buildout consumes scarce physical resources inside a fiscal regime with shrinking capacity to absorb supply shocks.
- The fund is positioned at this intersection: hard-asset demand driven by technological buildout compounding with hard-asset repricing driven by monetary erosion.

- The repricing of real assets

## Slide 08 (convexity)

- Section: WHAT WE EXPECT & FUND TERMS
- Title: Scenario matrix
- Thesis: How the portfolio performs across macro regimes

### What This Slide Adds

- Capital controls, financial repression, and fiscal dominance converge. Governments direct credit and restrict cross-border flows. Hard assets become the only credible store of value as nominal instruments are subordinated to sovereign funding needs.
- Hyperscaler capex floods into data centers, grid upgrades, and mineral supply chains. Physical bottlenecks — copper, transformers, cooling water — tighten even as productivity gains accelerate. Hard-asset holders benefit from both rising demand and scarcity premiums.
- Supply chains re-shore and duplicate across blocs, multiplying demand for physical capacity. Mineral and energy bottlenecks reach their most acute levels as every region races to build parallel infrastructure simultaneously.
- Yield-curve control pins rates below inflation, engineering negative real returns for savers. Capital migrates toward gold, farmland, and energy infrastructure — the only assets that preserve purchasing power when the sovereign deliberately debases its own currency.

- Section: REAL ASSETS - DEMAND
- Title: Critical mineral demand is accelerating across the board
- Thesis: Under stated policies, lithium demand more than doubles by 2030 and quadruples by 2040. Every mineral in this basket faces a supply gap.

### What This Slide Adds

- Under stated policies, lithium demand more than doubles by 2030 and quadruples by 2040. Every mineral in this basket faces a supply gap.

### Evidence (Only What Matters)

- Relative demand index (2024=100) rises sharply by 2030-2040 across all tracked minerals, with lithium as the steepest curve.
- Absolute-demand levels show copper as the largest tonnage bottleneck even when its index growth is lower than lithium.
- By 2030, demand indices span from ~117 (copper) to ~222 (lithium); by 2040 they widen to ~128 (copper) versus ~453 (lithium).
- In absolute 2024 demand, copper is already the dominant volume (~26.7 Mt) while lithium starts from a much smaller base (~0.205 Mt), which is why both growth and scale matter in underwriting supply gaps.

## Slide 26

- Section: MACRO THESIS
- Title: Beyond gold: silver, copper, and uranium are repricing on structural demand
- Thesis: Electrification, AI infrastructure, and reshoring are converging on the same constrained supply chains

### What This Slide Adds

- EVs, solar buildout, and AI data centers all push demand higher. Supply remains slow because major new mines take nearly two decades to scale.
- Industrial demand exceeds mine supply for the fourth consecutive year. Solar consumes about 20% of annual production while monetary demand rises.
- Nuclear capacity expansion and hyperscaler interest in baseload power increase long-cycle fuel demand after a decade of underinvestment.
- US industrial policy is deploying $280B (CHIPS), $370B (IRA), and $1.2T (IIJA) into capex-heavy buildout. Trade policy and export controls amplify pressure on already tight commodity chains.

### Evidence (Only What Matters)

- Since the 2022 trough window, copper rebounds to roughly 144 on the index basis while silver rises toward ~299, signaling a broad repricing across industrial and monetary metals.

## Slide 28

- Section: AI INFRASTRUCTURE
- Title: Why AI matters for this portfolio
- Thesis: Not a technology bet - a physical infrastructure bet. Every GPU cluster needs power, copper, and concrete.

### What This Slide Adds

- Large-platform 2026 capex guidance points to a multi-year physical infrastructure deployment phase.
- More copper per MW in data centers than traditional buildings, accelerating existing supply deficits.
- Projected US data center load by 2029 (from 4.3 GW in 2023), driving power-generation and grid capex.

### Evidence (Only What Matters)

- China electricity consumption rises from ~1,356 TWh (2000) to ~10,400 TWh (2025), highlighting the scale of power demand that accompanies industrial buildout.
- U.S. electricity consumption is comparatively flat over the same period (~3,802 to ~4,260 TWh), which reinforces how incremental AI load can strain a slower-growing base system.

- Title: US datacenter load doubles to 130 GW by 2030
- Thesis: 62 GW consumed in 2025, while capacity market pricing and queue dynamics indicate sustained power scarcity

### What This Slide Adds

- 62 GW consumed in 2025, while capacity market pricing and queue dynamics indicate sustained power scarcity

### Evidence (Only What Matters)

- Across analyst estimates, current U.S. datacenter load clusters around 50-103 GW.
- The same analyst set points to 106-230 GW in the 2030-2035 window, implying substantial expansion pressure on power infrastructure.

## Slide 40

- Section: THESIS B - ECONOMICS
- Title: Inference is 45% of compute spend and growing
- Thesis: Agentic workloads turn single prompts into sustained reasoning sessions

### What This Slide Adds

- Models get cheaper per token, but usage grows faster. As workloads shift from single queries to autonomous multi-step agents, inference share compounds and keeps physical infrastructure demand elevated.

### Evidence (Only What Matters)

- Inference share rises from about 10% (2018) toward roughly 70% by 2030 in the base path, while training share falls from ~90% toward ~30%.
- The key implication is not lower spend overall, but a larger persistent-runtime component that keeps power and hardware demand structurally high.

- Title: AI is deflationary in cognition. Inflationary in everything it needs to run
- Thesis: Physical bottlenecks are now the real constraint layer

### What This Slide Adds

- Electricity, copper, grid hardware, aluminum, advanced packaging, and specialized memory all face permitting, geopolitical, and supply-chain bottlenecks.

### Evidence (Only What Matters)

- Input-demand growth from 2024 to 2030 is large across electricity, copper, aluminum, and memory-linked bottlenecks.
- Labor-exposure and automation-intent data are simultaneously elevated, reinforcing the macro-labor channel.
- From 2024 to 2030, modeled input growth runs from roughly +76% (rare earths) to roughly +175% (aluminum) in the input set.
- Electricity example: about 415 (2024) rising to about 945 (2030).

- Title: There is no fiscally neutral path through AI displacement
- Thesis: Labor-heavy tax systems face rising automation pressure

### What This Slide Adds

- 60% of advanced-economy jobs are exposed to AI. UBI-style responses are possible in theory, but the US still relies on labor-heavy taxes and has not enacted a replacement tax base at comparable scale.
- Down from roughly $60B inflation-adjusted in 1979 while the labor force grew about 50%. Core WIOA Titles I and II are about $6B.
- Individual income plus social insurance receipts were $4.136T of $4.919T. VAT, AI-rent, and automation-tax proposals remain exploratory in current US federal policy.
- P.L. 119-21 tightened eligibility and work rules while shifting costs to states. CBO estimated 2.4M fewer SNAP participants in an average month.

### Evidence (Only What Matters)

- OECD social-spending benchmarks show large cross-country dispersion for labor-transition support: near 0.1% of GDP in the U.S. versus roughly 1.9% in Denmark.

## Slide 45

- Section: INTERSECTION - ENDGAME
- Title: Financial repression is the proven playbook for sovereign deleveraging
- Thesis: Real rates below nominal growth transfer wealth from nominal claims to the sovereign

### What This Slide Adds

- Debt-to-GDP fell 87 percentage points over 35 years of negative real rates, without default or hyperinflation.
- Real rates held below nominal growth for decades, silently transferring wealth from holders of nominal claims to the government. The same real assets that capture value from the AI buildout are the natural hedge.
- US federal debt-to-GDP has surpassed the 1946 wartime peak for the first time in history.
- Real annualized returns during financial repression (1946-1980)

### Evidence (Only What Matters)

- During the 1946-1980 repression period highlighted, long-duration Treasuries delivered about -2% real annualized returns while equities delivered about +6.8%, with real assets generally clustering above nominal bonds.

- Thesis: Three signal towers feed one decision engine: buildout velocity, macro constraints, and market regime

### What This Slide Adds

- The monitoring system is organized into three signal towers: AI buildout velocity, macro-constraint regime, and market-regime/positioning.
- AI buildout signals include hyperscaler capex revision breadth, grid queue conversion pace, packaging/HBM tightness, and training-to-inference mix.
- Macro signals include term premium and curve structure, real-rate vs breakeven decomposition, debt-service burden, and commodity supply-response lag.
- Market signals include valuation state (CAPE and earnings-yield spread), volatility/policy uncertainty, cross-asset stress transmission, and crowding deterioration.
- Signals are linked to explicit action cadence: daily sizing and gross/net updates, weekly conviction rotation and stop tightening, and monthly or event-driven re-underwrite decisions.

## Slide 50

- Section: WHAT WE EXPECT & FUND TERMS
- Title: Scenario analysis
- Thesis: Adjust assumptions to model projected returns. NOI escalates 2% annually. 10-year fund life

### What This Slide Adds

- Returns are most sensitive to three variables: exit cap rate, refinancing cost, and structural-long return.
- This module is the implementation layer for the thesis: collateral cash flow from NNN assets plus compounding from structural long exposure over a 10-year life.

### Evidence (Only What Matters)

- The engine tracks total NAV, real-estate equity, structural long sleeve, and fee/carry effects over a full 10-year lifecycle.
- Baseline control values: entry cap 6.0%, exit cap 6.0%, loan rate 5.5%, structural-long return 25.0%.
- Default-case outputs: gross IRR ~15.86%, LP net IRR ~13.94%, LP net MOIC ~3.687x.

### Mechanics (If Material)

- User controls: entry cap (3-9%), exit cap year 10 (4-10%), loan rate (3-9%), and structural-long return (-100% to 100%).
- Simulation states: real-estate equity, structural long sleeve, and reserve cash, rolled forward annually.
- Annual loop: apply property cash flow, amortize debt, apply sleeve returns, charge fees, and replenish debt-service reserve.
- Exit logic: year-10 property value from NOI/exit cap, net debt payoff, then apply preferred return and carry waterfall.
- Carry structure: 9% preferred hurdle, GP catch-up, then 20% participation above hurdle.
- Default controls also imply day-1 RE equity ~$9.0M, day-1 long sleeve ~$9.805M, year-1 debt service ~$0.749M, year-1 DSCR ~1.601x, and GP carry ~$13.44M.

### Source Note

- Source: Internal scenario model. Projections are illustrative. 2% management fee (years 1-5 on committed capital, years 6-10 on NAV) and 20% carry above 9% preferred return.

## Slide 51

- Section: WHAT WE EXPECT & FUND TERMS
- Title: Terms at a glance
- Thesis: Key economics, governance, and liquidity mechanics

### What This Slide Adds

- Fee structure: 2.0% management fee on committed capital in years 1-5, then 2.0% on NAV in years 6-10.
- Performance economics: 9.0% preferred return, 100% GP catch-up until 20% profit share, then 20% carry above hurdle.
- Formation fee: 1.0% of LP capital.
- Investment guidelines: permitted instruments include equities, ETFs, bonds, commodities, FX, futures, options, crypto, and Treasuries.
- Hard risk rails: max single position 10% NAV; no margin/borrowing; no outright shorts.
- Liquidity terms: years 1-5 full lock-up; years 6-10 GP discretionary liquidation window; secondary transfers priced at 90%/95% NAV with 5% spread accruing to the fund.
- Reporting and benchmarks: quarterly NAV plus annual letter; real-estate sleeve benchmarked to NCREIF, structural sleeve benchmarked to S&P 500 total return, fund-level as weighted composite.

## Slide 52

- Section: WHAT WE EXPECT & FUND TERMS
- Title: Risk architecture
- Thesis: Every risk has a structural mitigation built into the fund design

### What This Slide Adds

- The real-estate collar creates the structural floor; the structural long portfolio creates the upside.
- Principal risk factors include property-value decline, tenant default, refinancing-rate risk at year 10, structural-long market risk, and crypto/FX volatility at the position level.
- Structural mitigants include a hard 55% LTV cap, investment-grade NNN lease profile, NOI-surplus accumulation in U.S. Treasuries, 10% position limits, and prohibition of margin/shorts.
- Debt design (10-year term, 30-year amortization) reduces near-term refinancing fragility and limits forced-seller pathways.

### Evidence (Only What Matters)

- Stress framing in the underwriting pack: a 30% real-estate decline is still buffered by the equity cushion before LTV breach.
- A 50% structural-long drawdown does not force liquidation because margin leverage is prohibited.
- Tenant-default and rate-spike scenarios are addressed through reserve policy, lease quality, and fixed-term debt structure.

## Slide 53

- Section: LONG STRUCTURE PORTFOLIO SLEEVE
- Title: Traditional portfolio construction was designed for a regime that no longer exists
- Thesis: At current starting valuations, historical forward real return base rates for broad equity beta are materially compressed

### What This Slide Adds

- In high-starting-valuation regimes, index beta carries weaker long-horizon base rates. Allocation edge shifts to manager selection, dispersion capture, and non-index exposures that do not rely on multiple expansion.
- The 40+ bucket historically mapped to a -3.45% median next-10Y annualized real return, around the 98.8th percentile of historical CAPE readings.

### Evidence (Only What Matters)

- Historical next-10Y real equity returns compress as starting CAPE rises: the median shifts from about +11.0% annualized (CAPE <10) to about -3.45% (CAPE 40+).
- In the 40+ CAPE bucket, the interquartile range is also negative (roughly -4.41% to -3.03%), and sample size is small (~21 observations), underscoring both weak base rates and estimation uncertainty.

### Mechanics (If Material)

- Current Shiller CAPE reference used in this analysis: 40.38.

### What This Slide Adds

- Cluster-size progression across model generations highlights the scaling step from tens of thousands toward hundreds of thousands of accelerators.

### Evidence (Only What Matters)

- Estimated frontier training clusters expand from ~20-25k accelerators (2024 cohort) to around ~300k in the largest 2026 estimate (GPT-5.3-Codex).

### What This Slide Adds

- Packaging and memory bottlenecks cap delivered compute, even when wafer starts expand. Capacity pricing power accrues to upstream physical suppliers.
- TSMC CoWoS-S and HBM integration determine shipped accelerator volume
- HBM capacity per GPU - each generation requires more

## Slide 59

- Section: APPENDIX
- Title: How large language models work
- Thesis: A simplified view of the architecture behind frontier AI systems

### What This Slide Adds

- Frontier runs and inference fleets require semiconductors, power delivery, and cooling at utility scale.
- Performance improves predictably with more data, parameters, and compute. This drives recurring model scale-ups.
- Training is bursty and episodic. Inference is persistent and growing, making long-horizon infrastructure demand sticky.
- You do not need to predict which model wins. Every serious model requires the same physical inputs: chips, copper, power, and cooling.

### What This Slide Adds

- Every dollar here flows into chips, power, and cooling - the physical layer of the AI stack

### Evidence (Only What Matters)

- These values are estimated compute spend (infrastructure/training/inference cost), not revenue run rate.
- OpenAI and Anthropic compute spend both scale steeply over 2022-2025E.
- OpenAI compute spend rises from about $0.4B (2022) to about $16.0B (2025E).
- Anthropic compute spend rises from about $0.3B (2023) to about $6.8B (2025E).

- Thesis: Demand from electrification and AI infrastructure outpaces credible supply additions

### What This Slide Adds

- Demand from electrification and AI infrastructure outpaces credible supply additions

### Evidence (Only What Matters)

- The scenario path shows copper demand rising from ~27 Mt (2024) to ~34.1 Mt (2040) while modeled supply declines toward ~22 Mt.
- By 2035, the implied gap is on the order of ~27%, supporting the argument that announced projects are still insufficient.

### What This Slide Adds

- End-market growth must remain durable through an entire cycle.
- No plausible forced-seller path under adverse rates, spreads, or volumes.
- Return profile must clear hurdle rates without multiple-expansion heroics.
- Scarcity duration must exceed what current valuation already discounts.
